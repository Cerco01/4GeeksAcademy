    summary: |
      Junior Developer focused on Automation and Workflow Design.
      My journey started with a childhood passion for "tinkering" with hardware, which evolved into a professional obsession with making systems work efficiently.
      Currently, I am specializing in Python with a strong focus on Defensive Programming, Clean Architecture (OOP), and Strict Typing (MyPy/Ruff).
      I believe in a rigorous workflow: meticulous planning, functional validation with Pytest, and consistent documentation to build modular and scalable code.

      Outside of pure development, I am a Simracing enthusiast, which drives my interest in the intersection of AI, automation, and high-performance simulation.
      I am currently looking for my first professional opportunity to apply my technical discipline and continue growing in the tech industry.
